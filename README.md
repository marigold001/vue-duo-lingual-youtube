APIs don't work the assignment is done with static files.
Using this [JSON](https://api.myjson.com/bins/k1gz9). and this [YouTube library](https://www.teaching-materials.org/common/youtube.js)., create a simple page, which shows a list of YouTube Video cards with thumbnails. Make it pretty.
Improve on the task by removing the static JSON from the file, and using AJAX to fetch this [API](https://api.myjson.com/bins/13mms5).
Improve on task by creating two language buttons on page. Serbian and English. If a user clicks on the Serbian button, this will be recorded within a [cookie](https://gist.github.com/markomitranic/bfe23949ac6800a04e50decb3e5ab5cb), and the new list of videos will be fetched from this [API](https://api.myjson.com/bins/99ixh). If a user reloads the page, language will be automatically set based on the persisted cookie.
Make it pretty.
When users click on the link, open the embedded video in a modal window instead of a new tab. Of course, once the user closes the modal, the video playback should also stop.
